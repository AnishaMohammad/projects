                <h2>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h2>

                <p><b>Mahatma gandhi</b> Bapuji(2 October 1869 - 30 January 1948) was an
                     Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political 
                    ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for 
                    India's independence. 
                    Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the 
                    Inner Temple, 
                    London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in 
                    India, where he
                     was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to 
                     represent an Indian 
                     merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here 
                     that Gandhi raised a 
                     family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 
                     1915, aged 45, he 
                     returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, 
                    and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.</p>
